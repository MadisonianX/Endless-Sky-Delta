	`	The bank's architecture is what you would have called "futuristic"; a stark contrast to the somewhat squalid ancient colony on Uranus' only inhabited moon, Miranda. A doorman stands by each of the heavy glass doors. You are wearing your very best clothes, but you feel shabby next to them.`
	`	The loan broker's office is equally intimidating. Large computer monitors fill the walls, with stock quotes and other information spilling down them almost too fast to read. You occasionally glimpse the names of places that you have only seen in movies: Aldebaran. Tarazed. Earth.`
	`	The pen is heavy as lead but glides almost without friction as you print your initials on the bottom of page after page of ominous legal documents and sign several dozen statements, notices, and agreements. The banker, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to purchase, flips the pages past you quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`
	`	The only moment when he becomes truly animated is when explaining the Truth in Lending statement to you. "You are borrowing 60,000 credits," he says, "to be repaid over the course of one year. Your daily interest rate is 0.4%, which means that your daily payments are 313 credits, and by the end of the year you will have paid... 54,245 credits in interest. Sign here." He grins.`
	`	You sign your name one final time:`
	name
	`	The elevator is so well-tuned that you do not even realize it is moving until it has deposited you back in the lobby. But as you leave the bank, you are smiling. This crazy adventure suddenly feels real to you. You are going to do it. You are finally going to get off this moon.`
	`	Compared to the bank, you feel much more at home at the used shuttle dealership, walking among the rusted out hulks. You smell grease and dirt and rocket fuel; wonderful smells. There's only one hunk of junk within your current price range, the classic Sol Shuttle.`
	`	The old school shuttle may not be capable of hyperspace, but it's capable of low tonnage or single passenger jobs and came with a single mining laser installed, if you can find the right asteroids to harvest. It won't take long to pay off your loan, improve your credit, and buy another shuttle for your fleet, or to upgrade to a ship with hyperdrive so you can explore the stars beyond.`
	`	"All I ask is a fast shuttle and a star to steer her by..."`

	description `	You knew early on that your dream of owning a starship enterprise would never be realized without a lot of blood, sweat and tears, and today is the beginning of your journey into space as a captain of your very own Sol Shuttle, modest though it may be.`

	description "	This versatile shuttle can serve as a makeshift passenger transport or a cargo courier. It also happens to be the cheapest ship you can buy which is capable of hyperspace travel (Hyperdrive sold separately)."
	description `	Although they are typically unarmed, they have enough space for one weapon, which is the origin of the popular phrase, "as useless as a blaster cannon on a shuttlecraft. Enterprising captains with a great amount of patience have been known to add a mining laser."`
